
This repository contains the **backend GraphQL API** for a mini e-commerce application, built with **PHP 8.1+** and **MySQL 5.6+**.

It emphasizes **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, including polymorphism for product attributes, and adheres to **PSR standards**. The API is **framework-agnostic**, utilizing libraries like `webonyx/graphql-php` for GraphQL and `doctrine/dbal` for database interactions.

The GraphQL schema provides queries for **Categories, Products, and Orders**, and mutations for **placing orders** (including selected product attributes).

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [Postman API Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33043197/2sB34fngz3). This backend is designed to integrate with a React SPA frontend, such as the one found at [Selvster/mini-ecommerce-frontend](https://github.com/Selvster/mini-ecommerce-frontend).
